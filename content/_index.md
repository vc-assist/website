      content : I’ve used many productivity, dashboard, and class management apps before, but VCS Assist is one of the best I’ve used in a long time. It integrates flawlessly with many of our schools information systems like PowerSchool and Moodle, and offers bulletin announcements for admin use too. Its modularity is something to be impressed by too—it included widgets like a Grade Calculator(which I use all too often), digital classroom access, and quick access buttons for their incredibly responsive help desk. To top it all off, it’s UI and UX aren’t as gross as other school apps. In summary, VCS Assist is one of the best productivity/school/shortcut apps I’ve used. If your school doesn’t use it, you should definitely recommend it to them! In my experience on beta testing, the devs are incredibly professional and driven to spread the app. They’ll be more than happy to implement it with your school. All in all, 5 out of 5 stars!

      content : There are many apps VCHS students use on a daily basis. Notability, Google Drive, and GamePigeon, to name a few. But this app is like none other, and will revolutionize student success at VCHS for years to come. With VCS Assist, I can track how much my AP Statistics grade drops after each test, to the nearest hundredths place. This level of accuracy in grade reporting has never been heard of before. PowerSchool’s suboptimal rounding system will grow to fear their newest, more accurate, more statistically significant competition on the scene. The design and layout of the application is creative and wonderful. I’ve never ran into any issues while using VCS Assist. Whenever I have any questions about my data security and privacy, the app developers are always available to answer. They take user feedback very seriously, and work day and night to continuously update and support the app. VCS Assist is my favorite app, which I’ll use for the rest of my high school career. I can’t wait to wake up tomorrow and start off my day by checking my GPA.

      content : WOW! VC Assist is the best school-based app I've ever seen! Besides for calculating the super high scores I'll need on upcoming tests, I also get to check all my homework for each individual class. The UI/UX design is the best I've ever seen, with comfortable interactions, user-friendly interactions, and best of all, a light mode option. The VC Assist team is an amazing group of dedicated, hardworking students - whenever I have a problem, they resolve it almost immediately, even at 2 am! It's also worth noting that the team has an ridiculously funny sense of humor - on April Fool's Day, they cut everyone's GPA in half! VC Assist is the best app I've ever downloaded and I can't wait for future developments!
