### How We Started

VC Assist was born when Brayden Tam, our lovely CEO, found that using an elaborate spreadsheet to calculate grades was rather ineffectual. Then, he banded with a team of developers, Aditya Pawar and Akhil Datla, to create an app housing all the necessary information that a student may want. Over long and sleepless Discord calls, VC Assist was ready for beta testing. 

Continuing this path, the team brought on different team members, starting with Vivek Nadig to develop the frontend, and following up with Max Zhuang to oversee the publication of the app. As weâ€™ve continued to expand, the app has continued to grow, currently at 1275 active users. Currently, the team is working to develop both the junior high and parent versions along with the current high school version.
